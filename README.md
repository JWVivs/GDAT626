## Section I. Introduction
Although it is difficult, being able to predict future stock prices is an extremely valuable tool that can help guide individuals towards profitable stock purchases, and to gauge what their current stocks’ values will be. With this in mind, I decided to retrieve historical data on McDonald’s stock prices from 12/7/2014 to 12/7/2019 in an attempt to create a model capable of predicting future stock prices. Assuming I can get anything meaningful from this analysis (e.g. model that shows accurate or at the least promising prediction capabilities), then it would serve as a very useful model going forward that may provide further insight on how a predictive model should be built in order to accurately assess stock prices. The dataset is multivariate; however, I will be focusing on being able to assess the closing stock price, making this a univariate time-series analysis. The reason I am focusing on the closing stock price is because it is generally regarded as the most important price when analyzing how a stock performed during a trading day. 

## Section II. Exploratory Data Analysis
The dataset consisted of the date, the open, high, low, close, and adjusted prices, along with volume. As mentioned earlier, I wanted to assess the closing stock prices, which means that I will have to filter my dataset to feature only the closing price and date.
